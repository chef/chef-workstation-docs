The SSL certificate that's downloaded to the `/.chef/trusted_certs`
directory should be verified to ensure that it's, in fact, the same
certificate as the one located on Chef Infra Server. This can be
done by comparing the SHA-256 checksums.

1. View the checksum on Chef Infra Server:

    ```bash
    ssh ubuntu@chef-server.example.com sudo sha256sum /var/opt/opscode/nginx/ca/chef-server.example.com.crt
    ```

    The response is similar to:

    ```bash
    <ABC123checksum>  /var/opt/opscode/nginx/ca/chef-server.example.com.crt
    ```

2. View the checksum on the workstation:

    ```bash
    gsha256sum .chef/trusted_certs/chef-server.example.com.crt
    ```

    The response is similar to:

    ```bash
    <ABC123checksum>  .chef/trusted_certs/chef-server.example.com.crt
    ```

3. Verify that the checksum values are identical.
