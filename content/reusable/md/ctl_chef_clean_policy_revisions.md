Use the `chef clean-policy-revisions` subcommand to delete orphaned
policy revisions to Policyfile files from Chef Infra Server. An
orphaned policy revision isn't associated to any policy group and
therefore isn't in active use by any node. Use
`chef show-policy --orphans` to view a list of orphaned policy
revisions.
